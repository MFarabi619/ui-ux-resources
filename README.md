# UI/UX Resources

It is generally useful to create a project brief with the following information:
- About the client, including email and phone number.
- A collection of logos, images, and/or any other assets provided by the client.
- The structure of the website. Listo of pages and their purpose.
- Website content. 
- Design guidelines and/or philosophies. 

An example of a project brief can be found [here](https://github.com/MFarabi619/ui-ux-resources/blob/main/Web%20Design%20for%20Beginners%20-%20Project%20Brief.pdf).
